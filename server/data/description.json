With its minimalist design, Flask provides the flexibility to add only the required components to your application. The Flask-RESTful extension allows developers to quickly create API endpoints and manage request and response handling. Flask’s simplicity and ease of use make it a great choice for developers looking to build fast, scalable, and easy-to-maintain APIs. Its compatibility with various database systems and integration with authentication libraries allows for building secure, functional APIs for web applications."

        "description": "Ruby on Rails is a powerful web application framework written in Ruby, designed to make programming web applications easier and more productive. It follows the convention over configuration (CoC) principle, which allows developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with repetitive configuration. Rails provides a full stack of tools, including an ORM (ActiveRecord), routing, and a templating engine (ERB), making it easy to create dynamic web applications. Ruby on Rails is widely used for building web applications like e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and social networking sites."
